Iris Dataset Classification
📌 Project Overview

This project is a complete beginner-to-intermediate walkthrough of machine learning using Scikit-learn, implemented on the classic Iris dataset. It demonstrates how to think about machine learning as a process—from understanding the data to building, evaluating, and improving models.

Rather than focusing only on code, this project emphasizes ML concepts, reasoning, and evaluation, making it ideal for students and early-stage ML practitioners.
